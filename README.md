Hello my name is armando medina and i'm a motoko bootcamp graduate from may 2023
since then i've been developing in web3 and participating in a few hackatons

what i want to accomplish with this project is to have a content sharing platform CMS 100% on chain that can be used by any kind of users.
the idea is to have a main proyect creation and management canister and within that users will be able to create their own content
